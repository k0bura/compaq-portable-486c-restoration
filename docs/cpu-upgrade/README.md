# CPU Upgrade — Compaq Portable 486c

## Original CPU — IBM Blue Lightning DX2

The Compaq Portable 486c I had came with an **IBM Blue Lightning DX2** (486-V266GA) processor. This is a clock-doubled 486-class CPU running at 66 MHz (33 MHz bus, 2x multiplier). This compaq wasn't branded as the 66hmz model so it must have been upgraded at some point. The Blue Lightning was IBM's own take on the 486 architecture — it uses a write-back 16 KB internal cache and is pin-compatible with the Intel 486DX2-66.
